# TypingMastery

Welcome to `Typing Mastery`. There are many typing apps, but not all of them are looking to better your typing skills.

At `Typing Master` we provide our users with meta data that will help them target the trouble areas in their typing.

Do you have issues with specific letters on the keyboard? Do you want to target those words?
The words presented to you will constantly change to target your trouble area ( or new areas that arise ) and help you over come them with constant practice.

## Calculating WPM

[ ((all typed entries) / 5) - Uncorrected Errors ] / Time (min)

## TODO
1. Multi-language implementation (TBA)
2. Better UI on test page
3. Blog Implementation
4. Only show part of the array of words instead of the entire array. Could do it by hiding the elements with CSS (probably the best way)
  a. This is partially done, however, while typing the words moving causes some 'pain'. So probably try not to move the words, or find a better way of showing limited number of words. (Probably copy other such sites).
  b.
5.
